#### Installation & Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd Housing-Price-Predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model (generates data, optimizes parameters, saves components)
python train_model.py

# Launch web application
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Usage Examples
```python
# Basic prediction
from src.model import HousingPriceModel
model = HousingPriceModel()
model.load_model()
prediction = model.predict(X_new)

# Feature importance
feature_importance = model.get_feature_importance()

# Model explanation
from src.explainer import ModelExplainer
explainer = ModelExplainer(model.model, feature_names)
explanation = explainer.explain_price_factors(X_sample, features)
```

#### Configuration
Edit `config/config.py` to customize model and data parameters:
```python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    model_type: str = "xgboost"
    optimization_trials: int = 100
    cv_folds: int = 5

@dataclass
class DataConfig:
    sample_size: int = 10000  # Large dataset
    test_size: float = 0.2
    random_state: int = 42
```

#### Results and Reports
After training, the system generates:
- Model performance plots and feature importance visualizations
- SHAP summary plots for model interpretability
- Data distribution analysis and trend reports
- Trained model components saved for production use
